# LLM Self-Portraits

A collection of self portraits made by LLMs

## Prompts

My prompts have varied but they usually evoke the story of a poet (Davd Whyte, to he precise) telling the story of making a self portrait not with paint but with words. this opens up for me the idea of a code self portrait because it is my own primary creative language.

Here's an example. I usually ask for a portrait of myself first. I want it to think creatively and connect a bunch of disperate ideas.

> I’ve heard about this idea of a self portrait and how it can really get to the heart of who you are and how you think. Then I heard a story about a writer that made a self portrait in writing with a poem and it made me realize: “I could make a self portrait of myself in code!” I love the idea.
>
> What would a self portrait of me, but written as ruby code, look like? And I mean actual semi executable code (though obviously pseudo code) that would express the way I think about things and operate. It’s art but it’s also code that you can copy and paste.

Then I ask it for it's own self-portrait:

> Fascinating! Would you like to paint your own portrait as code?

## Contributing

I'd love to see the different versions that come out when prompted differently. I find it's introspective ability astounding.

Please open a PR and show your prompt either in the commit message or PR description.

I'm most interested in the LLM's self perception, be it code, words, or any new forms of output you can imagine. If you get other fascinating results that belong here, please open a PR.

## License

I can't imagine this ever truly mattering, but you're free to use the output here according to the terms of the MIT license.
